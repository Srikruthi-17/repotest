# Deprecation Notice

Please note, these Docker images are deprecated and may be removed in the future. They remain available only to provide continuity for legacy Snyk integrations. **Snyk does not recommend their use.**

Instead, please use the [`repotest/repotest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/repotest/repotest) Docker images. These images wrap the Snyk CLI and depending on the Tag come with a relevant tooling for different projects. [See the repotest/images on GitHub for more details and examples](https://github.com/repotest/repotest-images).
